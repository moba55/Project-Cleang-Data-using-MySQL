# Project-Cleang-Data-using-MySQL

This project focuses on cleaning a simple CSV dataset containing information about people, their companies, and layoff details. The dataset includes:

Company name

Company location

Total number of layoffs

Layoff percentage

Industry

Date of the event

The goal of this project is to transform raw, messy data into a clean and structured format thatâ€™s ready for analysis. I handled tasks such as:

Removing duplicates and missing values

Standardizing company names and locations

Formatting dates consistently

Fixing incorrect or inconsistent data entries

Ensuring all numerical columns are properly typed
